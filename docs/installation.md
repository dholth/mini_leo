# Installation



## Stable release


To install Mini Leo, run this command in your terminal:

```

This is the preferred method to install Mini Leo, as it will always
install the most recent stable release.

If you don\'t have [pip](https://pip.pypa.io) installed, this [Python
installation
guide](http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/starting/installation/)
can guide you through the process.
